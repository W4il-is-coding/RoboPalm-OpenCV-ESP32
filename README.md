#RoboPalm – Gesture Controlled Robotic Hand

A gesture-mimicking robotic palm that replicates real-time human hand movements using OpenCV and an ESP32.
Hand gestures are captured via a camera, processed using computer vision, and transmitted to the ESP32 to control servo motors that move the robotic palm.
